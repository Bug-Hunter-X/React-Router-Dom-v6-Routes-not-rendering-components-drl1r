# React Router Dom v6 Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with React Router Dom v6 where certain routes fail to render components, while others work correctly.  The issue is intermittent and the cause isn't immediately obvious from the code.

## Problem

The `App.js` file contains a basic React Router Dom v6 setup.  Routes are defined for "/", "/about", and "/contact". However, only the home route renders correctly. The other routes render nothing, even though the code structure is consistent.

## Solution

The solution provided in `AppSolution.js` fixes the issue by adding a `useLocation` hook to the components. This ensures that the components re-render when the URL changes. However, the root cause of why this is necessary in certain instances remains unclear. Further investigation might reveal a bug in React Router Dom v6 or a missing configuration step.
